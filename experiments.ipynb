    "Hufschmied ist ein harter Job. Es kommt schon mal vor, dass ein Pferd nervös reagiert, sich plötzlich bewegt oder mit den Beinen ausschlägt. Immer wieder mal steigt ein 700-Kilogramm-Pferd auf den Fuß des Schmieds – deshalb trägt Hannes Schuhe mit Metallkappen. »Ich muss schnell reagieren, um auszuweichen«, sagt er. Trotzdem: »Gerissene Daumensehnen, gebrochene Rippen, ausgekugelte Gelenke, geklemmte Finger: In meinem Beruf ist man wohl ähnlich oft verletzt wie in dem des Eishockey- oder Football-Spielers.«\n",
    "\n",
    "Um den Nutztieren Schmerzen zu ersparen und sie einsatzfähiger zu machen, versuchen die Menschen seit mehreren Tausend Jahren, die Hufe zu schützen. Im alten Griechenland und im Römischen Reich flocht man eine Art Socken aus Gräsern, Bast, Ginster oder Binsen um die Hufe. Man versuchte es mit Lappen, später mit »Hippo-Sandalen«. Das waren Eisenschuhe, in die die Pferdefüße gesteckt wurden. Vermutlich erfand dann das asiatische Reitervolk der Skythen die ersten Hufbeschläge. Sie brachten Eisen mit Nägeln an den Hufen an. Bis vor etwa 100 Jahren stellten Hufschmiede noch ihre eigenen Hufeisen her. Heute kauft man sie beim Fachhändler oder im Internet in vielen Größen und Materialien.\"\"\""

    "　　与文物对话，我们不难发现，顺天造物、和谐共生、天人合一，这些中华优秀传统文化中的生态理念，贯穿其中、赓续延绵，融入一代代人的生态保护实践。\n",
    "　　顺天造物\n",
    "　　文物蕴含了人们顺应自然、保护自然、开发自然的理念\n",
    "　　近两年，云南西双版纳一群亚洲象闯入人们视野，它们或觅食、或嬉戏，一路得到沿途群众的关照，最终安全回到保护区。野生大象在人们的爱护下享受着安全自由的生活，呈现出一派人与自然和谐相处的动人景象。\n",
    "　　象，在中国传统文化中，有着“祥”的象征意义。东汉班固在《白虎通义·礼乐》中说：“武王曰《象》者，象太平而作乐，示已太平也”。象，成为中华传统文化中重要的动物形象之一。\n",
    "　　中国社会科学院学部委员、考古研究所研究员冯时说：“智慧的先人驯服大象，借助大象行路、运输，适度为己所用，巧妙地顺应自然界的特征，追求人和自然和谐共处。”\n",
    "　　山东曲阜孔子博物馆内，明代竹雕“万象回春”图摆件，大象身高腹大，回首卷尾，通体饰回纹。象背上，两人单跪跨步，双手捧抬盆栽万年青，寓意为“万象回春”。首都师范大学历史学院教授王涛说，儒家思想与大象有着千丝万缕的关联。大象诚实敦厚，象征诚信；长鼻竖立，可象征儒家的“中庸之道”；象鼻下垂，可象征儒家提倡的“礼”；象牙虽锋利，却从不杀戮无辜，又可代表“仁”。“所以，大象也被视为君子的象征。”\n",
    "　　中华文明是世界上最早发展农业的文明之一，诸多文物体现了中国人因地制宜、因势而动、借势而为等理念。\n",
    "　　走进广东韶关市博物馆，一件东晋时期的水田作业模型引人注目。模型为酱褐釉陶质地，底部是长方形水田，中央纵贯一条田埂，左右两侧各有一人一牛，牛颈部套有绳索，身后二人手持农具，作犁地耙田状。王涛认为，这件陶器展示出的水田农业，顺应了南方地区的湿润气候，是我国劳动人民顺应自然的创造。\n",
    "　　顺天造物的观念，贯穿中华民族的发展历史，留下了一个个伟大的创造。浙江杭州市民周雪妮喜欢周末带着孩子到苏堤参观：“苏堤不仅可以让孩子领略一年四季不同的景色，还可以了解背后的人文内涵。”\n",
    "　　始建于北宋元祐五年的苏堤，是苏东坡任杭州知州时疏浚西湖，利用挖出的淤泥葑草堆筑起一条南北走向的堤岸。这条将美学、生态与水利工程紧密结合的堤坝，具有极高的人文和生态价值，穿越时间的长河，成为杭州文化标识之一。\n",
    "　　京杭大运河江苏扬州河段，著名的“三湾抵一坝”同样是顺应自然的创新。为降低流速，惯用方法多为裁弯取直，扬州当地人却反其道而行之，以三道河湾阻滞水流、提升水位，以保运河安澜。\n",
    "　　近年来，扬州进一步将生态文明与历史文化相结合，建设扬州运河三湾生态文化公园，古老运河成为市民休闲游玩好去处。\n",
    "　　和谐共生\n",
    "　　先人的环保意识与今日的可持续发展思想一脉相承\n",
    "　　秋天，云南红河哈尼梯田进入观赏季，阳光洒在层层叠叠的梯田上，灌满水的梯田映照着天光云影，美不胜收。\n",
    "　　这是以哈尼族为主的各族人民利用“一山分四季，十里不同天”“山有多高，水有多高”的特殊地理气候，发挥聪明才智和创造精神开垦的上百万亩农业生态奇观。2013年，它被正式列入《世界遗产名录》。\n",
    "　　“不同于其他世遗，哈尼梯田是一种新型的文化遗产。”国家文物局相关负责人说，红河哈尼梯田文化景观的历史可追溯到唐代，体现了人文文化和农耕文化的有机结合。1300多年来，哈尼梯田森林、村寨、梯田、水系“四素同构”的农业生态系统延续至今，呈现了人与自然和谐相处的画卷，给恒久发展提供启示。\n",
    "　　和谐共生、永续发展，倡导人和自然、人和人之间的和谐共存，共同发展。\n",
    "　　冯时介绍，早在商代，和谐共生的环保思想就已出现。研究甲骨文史料发现，商王田猎后，将所得猎物分类记录，一般的猎物命名为“获”和“擒”。但在用火烧的方法捕猎时，有可能误伤，商人将原本禁止猎取的动物单独列出，如幼兽等，此类动物称为“蔺赤”，并不算入打猎所得，以表禁忌。\n",
    "　　湖北省博物馆展出的云梦睡虎地秦简，用大量的墨书秦篆记录着公元前的律令历法。其中的《田律》是我国迄今为止发现的最早的环保法律条文。《田律》记载，春二月，禁止“雍（壅）堤水”，即禁止堵塞河道；同时，也有不准采摘刚发芽的植物，不准捕捉幼兽、卵和幼鸟，不准毒杀鱼鳖，放置陷阱、渔网的记载，直到七月才能解除这些禁令。按照节令而有所区别的生态保护规定，体现出“顺时施政”的智慧。\n",
    "　　片片龟甲、道道简牍，记录着先人的环保意识，与今日的可持续发展思想一脉相承。\n",
    "　　环保、节能、可持续，也融入了器物设计的理念和工艺，推动了技术进步。距今7000—5000年的仰韶文化，常见一类陶器—小口尖底瓶，此前常被推测是汲水用具。最新的研究显示，很多陶器底部的残留物是以黍、粟等谷物为原料制作的发酵酒。王涛说，小口尖底，有利于减少酒精挥发，保存酒香，尖底则有助于酒液中的杂质沉淀，使酒质更加清澈。这种设计体现了先民对酿酒工艺的深刻理解和精湛工艺。\n",
    "　　陕西历史博物馆的文物彩绘雁鱼铜灯，“定格”了鸿雁回首衔鱼的瞬间。造型优美、栩栩如生的器型，由雁首颈、雁体、灯盘、灯罩套合而成，雁腹内部装水，灯盘中盛放燃料，灯罩由两爿构成，转动其中一爿，可调节灯光亮度。细长的雁颈和雁首，会将烟雾下沉排入雁腹的水中，起到灭烟除尘的作用。\n",
    "　　可以说，和谐共生的理念促进技术创新、产业升级，并不断造福于人类。\n",
    "　　天人合一\n",
    "　　思考自然之道，处理好天、地、人三者的关系\n",
    "　　近日，一款天宫藻井文创冰箱贴的畅销，带火了北京古代建筑博物馆。走进北京古代建筑博物馆，高约4米、共6层的天宫藻井华丽夺目。藻井巨大的圆形外围装饰有68座精雕细琢、繁复精美的天宫楼阁建筑。藻井最上方的星空共有1472颗金色星宿，构成一幅星空图。博物馆志愿者、北京八中教师南洋说，藻井上重檐歇山的楼阁和星星似乎在诉说着中国人千年来对自然、对宇宙的追求，体现了中国古人敬畏天、探索天文规律的努力。\n",
    "　　“天地与我并生，而万物与我为一”，《庄子·齐物论》对“天人合一”思想作出了阐释。冯时说：“天人合一启示我们，应思考自然之道，处理好天、地、人三者的关系。”\n",
    "　　河南省博物院内，高大庄严的杜岭方鼎，吸引着慕名而来的观众。大鼎双耳、方腹，4个圆柱形空足，器表饰饕餮纹与乳钉纹。鼎，是“天人合一”在器物层面的体现。\n",
    "　　“中国传统文化奉行‘所祭必象其类’的思想，古人认为天圆地方，天为阳，地为阴，故以圆鼎祭天，以属阳的牛、羊等动物作为牺牲；方鼎祭地，祭祀用属阴的谷物。”冯时说，天人合一的文化思想以器物为载体，在祭祀活动中尤为明显。“祭天以圜丘，礼地以方丘，都是这种观念的反映。”\n",
    "　　天人合一的理念把人置于自然中，认为人与自然相互依赖，互为一体，体现出中华民族尊崇自然、尊重自然规律、崇尚和谐的精神追求。\n",
    "　　玉有领璧，收藏于故宫博物院，双面各饰有同心圆形状的三圈弦纹。冯时说，古人用玉璧祭天，圆形的天可以描述为同心圆，表现的是太阳的运动轨迹。而祭地则以方中纳圆的玉琮，出土于安阳殷墟妇好墓的弦纹玉琮，正是这种中心呈圆筒状的方形柱体。《礼记》认为“地载万物，天垂象。取财于地，取法于天”，故内圆外方，意为地载万物、因天立法。受天人合一观念的影响，璧、琮两种礼器的固有形制确定下来并得以不断延续。\n",
    "　　一条中轴线，贯穿南北、联通古今。今年，“北京中轴线—中国理想都城秩序的杰作”被列入《世界遗产名录》。这条始建于13世纪，形成于16世纪，不断演进发展至今的北京中轴线，是中国传统都城中轴线发展至成熟阶段的杰出范例，至今仍发挥着重要作用。\n",
    "　　清华大学建筑学院教授吕舟说：“在中国文化传统中，都城位置的选择具有极其重要的意义，它在国土中的位置要符合观念中的中心地位，这也是中华文明‘天人合一’观念的重要组成部分。”可以说，北京中轴线不仅为中华文化传统和精神追求提供了特殊的物质见证，其中蕴藏的“天人合一”理念，也体现出中国人对人与自然和谐发展的认识和思考。\n",
    "　　“天人合一”不仅体现在祭祀与礼仪，也要求顺应四时变化。冯时认为，一年四季寒暑更替，古人相信，器用须合于春生、夏长、秋收、冬藏的时令变化，才能达成天、地、人三者的和谐。\n",
    "　　顺天造物、和谐共生、天人合一等理念沉淀在中华优秀传统文化基因中赓续传承。今天，“绿水青山就是金山银山”的生态文明观念已深入人心。爱绿护绿，爱鸟护鸟，从孩子教育开始，就已播下了生态环保的种子。绿色出行、低碳生活、减少排放、循环发展的观念，渗透到经济发展、社会生活的方方面面。古老智慧融入现代化建设，人与自然和谐共生的中国式现代化画卷，徐徐展开。\"\"\""
